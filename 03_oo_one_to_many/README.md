# OO One to Many

Today we're going to learn about how to design our projects to relate to the real world!

Some things we need to make sure we're on the same page about with the setup:
- `Gemfile` is a file for us so we can make sure our projects have the same dependencies.
We want to make sure if someone clones our code down, they have the same setup as us!
- `bin/` is a folder that we are going to use to store all the files we want to run!
These files are important in order to check if our code can work together.
- `lib/` is a folder that will contain all of our definitions. This folder will contain all of our classes that we define such as `Book` and `Author`.
