# Functional Programming
- functions as objects
  - pass around
  - pass as arguments to functions
  - return from functions unexecuted
- difference between a function reference and execution
- arrows
  - if you have curlies, need to return
  - options syntax around it
- callbacks
  - array methods: .forEach, .map, .filter, .reduce, .sort
    - MDN for documentation
    - what are return value, what are arguments, what args are optional, does it mutate
- higher-order functions
  - functions that take a callback function argument or return a refernce to a function
- closures
  - using functions to encapsulate data (variable info, argument info, etc) into an interior function and protect it from the outside world
- IIFEs
  - Immediately Invoked Function Expression
  - wrap the definition in parentheses and execute with parentheses
  - when we have code we only want to be executed once
  - don't save the outer function to a variable
- pure functions
  - not mutate data, return a copy with new data
  - same input, same output
